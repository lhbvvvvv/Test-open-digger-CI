# Community Guidelines

## Things you should take into Consideration

**Be considerate**

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.

**Be welcoming and open-minded**

Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started. We value, encourage all types of contributions.

**Be respectful**

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don‚Äôt allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

**Be collaborative**

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

**Be inclusive**

Everyone within the community has the right to speak to any decision taken. You should have the freedom to participate in different decisions and actions taken within the community publically and put forward your perspective. Adding your perspective will result in a more broad outcome towards that decision. Whoever you are, you have a unique perspective and unique skills that you can contribute to a collective.

**Take responsibility for our words and our actions**

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully and work to right the wrong.

**Ask for help when unsure**

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

**Step down considerately**

When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

## What is not Allowed?

* **Threats of violence**- You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others.
* **Sexually obscene content -**The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* **Bullying**- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* **Harassment**- Public or private harassment
* **Invasion of privacy**- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* **Misinformation**- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
# Path to Leadership

## What does leadership mean to the OpenDigger community?

A leader is someone who has specific decision-making power over some part of a group and thus additional accountability and can help with prioritizing and planning activities in the project.

# Merit System Rules

Merits can be divided into two parts: total merits and available merits. Total merits are the sum of all merits and available merits refer to how many merits can be used to redeem reports or other valuable objects.

## Weekly Meeting

|Role|merits|
|:----|:----|
|Meeting participants|1|
|Meeting host|13|
|Topic proposer|3|
|Topic participants|2|

The meeting host needs to count the merits of every participant and then create a pull request to change the merits. The pull request merged after the second inspection by the committer.

## Issue

|Action|Role|merits|Others|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Open an issue and others involved|Proposer|3|Most once|
|Comment on issues|Commenter|3 (Including yourself)|Up to 21 merits per person per day|
|Receive evaluation instructions from others|Proposer|merits corresponding to the instruction|Up to 21 merits each issue|

## Pull Request

|Action|Role|merits|Others|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Open a pull request and others involved|Proposer|3|Most once|
|Comment on pull requests|Commenter|3 (Including yourself)|Up to 21 merits per person per day|
|Review others' pull requests|Reviewer|8||
|A pull request be merged|Proposer|8|    |
|Receive evaluation instructions from others|Proposer|merits corresponding to the instruction|Up to 34 merits|

## Evaluation instruction

When someone brings an evaluation instruction in a comment, Hypertrons ü§ñÔ∏è will automatically recognize it.

|  |Instruction|merit|Contributor|Committer|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|helpful|/good|3|Yes|Yes|
|nice|/great|5|Yes|Yes|
|awesome|/excellent|8|No|Yes|
|incredible|/fantastic|13|No|Yes|

The evaluation instruction of the pull request is similar to the issue.

## merits update

merits will be automatically updated at 02:00 UTC+8 every day by Hypertrons.

## Others

A committer can modify merits manually if there may be some unkind actions such as personal attacks and malicious scoring.



**Any opinions will be welcomed!**
